                <p class="content">
                    As a programmer, I've often felt the frustration of setting up remote access tools that require juggling multiple software installations or navigating through complex configurations. This hassle inspired me to develop a command-line tool that simplifies the entire process, making remote access as seamless and straightforward as possible.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    I wanted to design a tool that eliminates the need for any downloads or installations on either side of the connection. This led me to the innovative idea of using a web browser as the console. By leveraging the widespread availability and user-friendliness of web browsers, I was able to create a solution that anyone can use effortlessly, regardless of their technical expertise.

                <h3 class="subtitle">How It Works</h3>
                <p class="content">
                    TerminalMirror streamlines terminal session sharing by leveraging widely available tools like <code>curl</code> and <code>script</code>. Here's how it works:
                </p>
                <ul class="content">
                    <li><strong>Transmit Data:</strong> Your terminal inputs and outputs are securely transmitted to the TerminalMirror website using an authorization token.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Anywhere:</strong> Share the generated link with others, allowing them to view your terminal session directly in their web browser.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Sharing:</strong> You maintain full control over the session and can stop sharing at any time by pressing <code>Ctrl + C</code>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="content">
                    TerminalMirror is designed with security and simplicity in mind, ensuring that your terminal sessions are both safe and easy to share.
